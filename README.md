# Personalized Learning Platform with AI Agents

This project is a personalized learning platform that leverages AI agents to enhance the learning experience. The platform includes three main AI agents:

2. **MaterialRecommendationAgent**: Recommends educational materials tailored to the student's learning style.
3. **QuestionAnsweringAgent**: Answers students' questions related to their studies.

The platform is built using Flask for the web application framework and the `autogen` library for creating and managing AI agents.

## Features
- **Learning Style Analysis**: Provide personalized learning style analysis to better understand how each student learns.
